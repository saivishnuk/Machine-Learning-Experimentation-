# Machine-Learning-Experimentation-
Experimentation using different Machine Learning algorithms  

Using different machine learning algorithms for making a different 

Two different data sets have been used for the experimentation:
1.	Mashable dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity
2.	Telemarketing dataset: bank-additional-full.csv from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing


Algorithms experimented with:
1. •	Linear Regression with normal equations\
   •	Linear Regression with gradient descent\
   •	Logistic Regression with normal equations\
   •	Logistic Regression with gradient descent

   
2. •	SVM\
   •	Decision Trees \
   •	Boosting (Adaboost)

   
3. •	Neural Networks\
   •	KNN   


4. •	Clustering: (Hard Clustering, Soft Clustering) \
   •	Dimensonality Reduciton: (Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, Random Projections) \
   •	Experimentaiton using Neural Networks on reduced dimensions
