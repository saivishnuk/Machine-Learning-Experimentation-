Objective of this exercise:

Experimentation of classification algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree and Boosting) on two problems:

• Predict whether the articles published by Mashable will be high shared or low shared

• Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing

Data sets used:
1.	Mashable dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity
2.	Telemarketing dataset: bank-additional-full.csv from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

Code: 
1.	Python: “Data_cleaning and SVM.ipynb” for data cleaning and SVM
2.	R: “decisontree_and_ensemble.R” for decision trees and Ensemble

Execution order:
1.	Download the data from the URL’s mentioned above
2.	Use first part of the python code for data cleaning, which generates intermediate data sets which are used as input for R code
3.	Use rest of the python code for SVM
4.	Use outputs generated by python code as input for R code
5.	Install required packages in R, if already not installed 
6.	Use R code for decision tree and Ensemble
