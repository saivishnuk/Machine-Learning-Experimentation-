Objective of this exercise:

Experimentation of classification algorithms (Neural Networks and KNN) for two problems:

• Predict whether the articles published by Mashable will be shared more number of times or less number of times

• Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing

Data sets used:
1.	Mashable dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity
2.	Telemarketing dataset: bank-additional-full.csv from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

Code: 
Run the python code with the data in the same folder as the code. 

Execution order:
1.	Download the data from the URL’s mentioned above or use the data provided along with the code
2.	Place the data and code in the same folder
3.	Use Jupyter Notebooks to run the code
